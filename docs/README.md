# Principia Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the Principia library.

Principia is a framework for building self-verifying, robust, and elegant software by making all implicit assumptions—about both data and behavior—explicit and verifiable at runtime.

## Table of Contents

1.  **[Core Philosophy: The Assumption-Assertion-Consequence Model](./philosophy.md)**
    *   Learn about the foundational model that drives Principia's design.

2.  **[Getting Started: Basic Data Validation](./getting_started.md)**
    *   A guide to writing your first contracts for data validation (types, ranges, formats, etc.).

3.  **[Advanced Guide: Behavioral Contracts](./behavioral_contracts.md)**
    *   Unlock the full power of Principia by writing contracts that verify the *behavior* of your dependencies (e.g., network clients, services, and other functions).

4.  **[API Reference](./api_reference.md)**
    *   A detailed reference for all public classes and functions in the Principia library.
